## Public Feeds

* [Transit Land](https://transit.land/) - Transitland brings together many sources of transit data to build a directory of operators and feeds that can be edited by transit enthusiasts and developers.    
* [Transit Feeds](http://transitfeeds.com/) - An extensive archive of public transit data for software developers, transit agencies and more.       
* [Google Public Feeds](https://code.google.com/archive/p/googletransitdatafeed/wikis/PublicFeeds.wiki) - This is a list of transit schedule data published by transit agencies and operators in GTFS format for developers to use.

* [Node-GTFS](https://github.com/brendannee/node-gtfs) - node-GTFS loads transit data in GTFS format, unzips it and stores it to a MongoDB database. 
* [gtfs-realtime-bindings](https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings) - Language bindings generated from the GTFS-realtime protocol buffer spec for popular languages.       
* [gtfs_SQL_importer](https://github.com/cbick/gtfs_SQL_importer) - Import GTFS data to SQL.

* [GTFS-viz](https://github.com/vasile/GTFS-viz) - Converts a GTFS dataset into a SQLite DB + GeoJSONs / KMLs.   
* [onebusaway-gtfs-modules](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-gtfs-modules) - A Java-based library for reading, writing, and transforming public transit data in the GTFS format, including database support.   
* [GTFS Ruby](https://github.com/nerdEd/gtfs) - A Ruby wrapper for the General Transit Feed Specification.  
* [GTFS Importer](https://github.com/jvashishtha/GTFSImporter) - Import GTFS data to SQLite for use in iOS and Android apps.
* [GTFSDB](https://github.com/OpenTransitTools/gtfsdb) - Python code that will load GTFS data into a relational database, and SQLAlchemy ORM bindings to the GTFS tables in the gtfsdb.
* [gtfs osm sync](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-osm-sync) - Synchronizes public transportation data in GTFS format with OpenStreetMap.org.
* [GTFSrDB - GTFS-realtime to Database](https://github.com/mattwigway/gtfsrdb) - GTFSrDB loads GTFS-realtime data to a database.
* [GTFS MySQL IMPORT SCRIPT](https://github.com/sbma44/py-gtfs-mysql) - Python scripts to import a GTFS dataset into a basic MySQL database.
* [GTFS as a Django app](https://github.com/tulsawebdevs/django-multi-gtfs) - Django app to import and export General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS).  
* [GeoTrellis Transit](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-transit) - API and libraries for generating travelsheds from OSM & GTFS data.    
* [GTFS Feed Parser](https://github.com/itinero/GTFS) - .Net/Mono implementation of a General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) feed parser. 
* [FastGtfs](https://github.com/nicomazz/fastgtfs) - Rust library to parse and merge GTFS data, designed for embedded systems. It converts the txt format in a binary one, faster to parse. It also provides a navigator (given start and destination point gives several results), and enables the creation a network simulation in real time.

## Data Viewers

* [GTFS to HTML](https://github.com/brendannee/gtfs-to-html) - Build HTML timetables from GTFS transit data.  
* [GTFS Visualizations](https://github.com/cmichi/gtfs-visualizations) - Visualizing GTFS data.
* [onebusaway gtfs realtime visualizer](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-gtfs-realtime-visualizer) - A visualizer for GTFS-realtime transit data.  
* [GTFS Visualizer](https://github.com/AndreNDarcie/gtfs-visualizer) - Library responsible for generating HTML data based on the GTFS format.
* [LiveMap](https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings) - Real-time visualization of public transportation based on parsed GTFS data sets.

## Multimodal Trip Planning

* [Open Trip Planner](http://www.opentripplanner.org/) - OpenTripPlanner provides a range of passenger information and transportation network analysis features using our infrastructure for finding itineraries combining transit, pedestrian, bike, and car segments.  

## Editors
